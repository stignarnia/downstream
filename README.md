**This program does not work if your school or workplace uses a custom Single Sign On like Shibboleth, in that case give a look at the links above**  
**It has been tested in the following schools or workplaces (feel free to add yours if you used this successfully)**
* Humanitas University

## PREREQUISITES
If you don't know what these are just keep reading

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/it/download/): anything above v8.0 seems to work.
* [**aria2**](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases): this needs to be in your `$PATH` (for example, copy `aria2c.exe` to `C:\Windows`). PoliDown calls `aria2c` with a bunch of arguments in order to improve the download speed.
* [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): a recent version (year 2019 or above), in [`$PATH`](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10).

## INSTALLATION AND USAGE

* Click on `code`, then `Download ZIP`
* Extract the content in the folder you prefer, we'll call it `installationfolder`

If you are on Windows keep reading, otherwise google how to get the prerequisites, then skip to command line usage

* Follow the tutorial below until the succesful execution of the `npm install` command
* double click on the `Downstream Launcher.bat` file and enjoy

### WINDOWS TUTORIAL
**N.B:** ffmpeg.zeranoe.com closed since Sep 18, 2020. If you are following the video tutorial, download ffmpeg from another source available on the [ffmpeg website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (nightly build is no longer required)

**N.B:** This video was made for [PoliDown](https://github.com/sup3rgiu/PoliDown), ignore everything after the succesful execution of the `npm install` command
